		The package provides a workflow for creating a Darwin Core standard-compliant data archive
		("a data package"). This facilitates FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable;
		https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data 	sharing and uploading of Darwin Core archives
		(data packages) to repositories such as GBIF.  The Living Norway package 
		also provides tools for the processing and manipulation of metadata associated with Darwin Core
		archives and for the import and export of metadata according to the EML (Ecological Metadata
		Language; https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)
    	standard.
