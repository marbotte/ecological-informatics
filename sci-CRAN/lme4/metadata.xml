		Linear Mixed-Effects Models using 'Eigen' and S4 // Fit linear
		and generalized linear mixed-effects models. The models and
		their components are represented using S4 classes and methods.
		The core computational algorithms are implemented using the
		'Eigen' C++ library for numerical linear algebra and
		'RcppEigen' "glue".
