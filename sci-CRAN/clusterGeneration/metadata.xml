		Random Cluster Generation (with Specified Degree of Separation)
		// We developed the clusterGeneration package to provide
		functions for generating random clusters, generating random
		covariance/correlation matrices, calculating a separation index
		(data and population version) for pairs of clusters or cluster
		distributions, and 1-D and 2-D projection plots to visualize
		clusters.  The package also contains a function to generate
		random clusters based on factorial designs with factors such as
		degree of separation, number of clusters, number of variables,
		number of noisy variables.
